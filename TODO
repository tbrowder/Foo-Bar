First make the module show and download its two files when installed
+ it's definitive: the /resiurces MUST be duplicated in the META6.json file

Then do the same with local (hopefully without changing anything)
+ it's definitive: it also works locally

Add the run-before-build script to add the minimum subs to:
  + note bin/script should be named per module name but
    lower case: Foo::Bar => foo-bar
  + sync /resources and META6.json resources' list
  + added subs should be named something like 'mi6-helper-X'
    or 'helper-X'
